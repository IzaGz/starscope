StarScope
=========

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/starscope.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/starscope)

Anyone who has done much programming in C (or C++) on a unix-based OS has come
across the fantastic [Cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/) tool. Sadly, it
only works for C (and sort of works for C++).

StarScope is a similar tool for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and
[Golang](http://golang.org/), with a design intended to make it easy to add
support for other languages at some point within the same framework (thus the
name StarScope, ie \*scope).

Install it as a gem (requires at least Ruby 1.9.3):
```
$ gem install starscope
```

Build your database, by just running it in the project directory:
```
$ cd ~/my-project
$ starscope
```

Ask it things with `-q`
```
$ starscope -q calls,new # Lists all callers of new
```

Export it for use with your editor
```
$ starscope -e ctags
```
or
```
$ starscope -e cscope
```
