StarScope
=========

Anyone who has done much programming in C (or C++) on a unix-based OS has come
across the fantastic Cscope tool [1]. Sadly, it only works for C (and sort of
works for C++).

StarScope is a similar tool for Ruby, with a design intended to make it easy to
add support for other languages at some point within the same framework.
