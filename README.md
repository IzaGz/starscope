Anyone who has done much programming in C (or C++) on a Unix-based OS has come
across the fantastic [Cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/) tool. Sadly, it
only works for C (and sort of works for C++).

Starscope is a similar tool for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and
[Golang](https://golang.org/), with a design intended to make it easy to add
[support for other languages](doc/LANGUAGE_SUPPORT.md) within the same framework
(thus the name Starscope, i.e. \*scope).

Install it as a gem:
```
$ gem install starscope
```

Build your database by just running it in the project directory:
```
$ cd ~/my-project
$ starscope
```

Ask it things directly:
```
$ starscope -q calls,new # Lists all callers of new
```

Export it to various existing formats for automatic integration with your editor:
```
$ starscope -e ctags
$ starscope -e cscope
```
